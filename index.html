        <p>Welcome! My name is Luis Seijo. I am a full-time student at Harford Community College majoring in Data Science. 
          My career goal is to move away from Logistics and transition into Data Science and one day land a position in Machine Learning. I served six honorable years in the Delaware Air National Guard 
          and I'm a big NBA fan cheering for the Cleveland Cavaliers. Well, enough about me. I hope you enjoy my portfolio page!

    <p class="pltp">LeBron James made the hardest decision in 2010. He decided to take his talents to South Beach, Miami to play for the Miami Heat.
        After winning two championships with the Miami Heat. LeBron made a promise to come home (2014) and win a ring for the Cleveland Cavaliers.
        LeBron James lead the Cavs to a championship in 2016 where they won 51 games during the regular season. LeBron left the Cavs again after the 2017 season. The Cavs
        struggled without their superstar player. The following two seasons Cleveland only won 19/81 games with the total wins dropping a whopping 62%.
        After the 2019 NBA season, the Cavs made adjustments with drafting new players and signing strong bench players. The Cavs jumped dramatically in wins from 2019 to 2022 with a 91% difference.
